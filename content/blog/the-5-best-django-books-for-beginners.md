Hi there!

If you're looking to begin your software development career and you're wondering where to begin, you are in the right place. Or perhaps, you have free time on your hands and you'd like to try something new or learn a new framework, then welcome and take a seat at the back.

The first step is to go through the documentation to get a feel of what Django is all about then try out the tutorials. A project's documentation is always the first step in embarking on any project.

1. Django for Begineers
2. Django3 By Example
3. Django for APIs
4. Django for Professionals
5. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2
