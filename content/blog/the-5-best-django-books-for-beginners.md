I know what you are thinking. "There are a million and one "Top Django books for beginners" why is this any different?"

This is a bit different because it is a very nice path to mastering Django. Take it from someone who has tried countless book tutorials and video tutorials. You do not want to get lost in that bottomless pit. Hence, I have taken the time to highlight the top 5 books you'll have to follow to quickly master and solve problems with Django.

Moreso, most of the other recommendations just write a list of Django books without considering the learning path. Mine is quite different. If you follow my recommendation in the order presented in this blog post, you will master Django in no time. Convinced? Alright let's move!

Introduction

If you're looking to begin your software development career and you're wondering where to begin, you are in the right place. Or perhaps, you have free time on your hands and you'd like to try something new or learn a new framework, then welcome and take a seat at the back.

The first step is to go through the documentation to get a feel of what Django is all about then try out the tutorials. A project's documentation is always the first step in embarking on any project.

1. Django for Begineers
2. Django3 By Example
3. Django for APIs
4. Django for Professionals
5. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2
