I know what you are thinking; _"There are a million and one 'Top Django books for beginners', why is this any different?"_

Well, take it from someone who has tried countless book tutorials and video tutorials. You do not want to get lost in that dark-frustrating-bottomless pit. Hence, I have taken the time to highlight the top 5 books you'll have to follow to quickly master and solve problems with Django.

Moreso, most of the other recommendations just write a list of Django books without considering the learning path. Mine is quite different. If you follow my recommendation in the order presented in this blog post, you will master Django in no time. Convinced? Alright, let's move!

PS: I wasn't paid to promote any of the books mentioned here.

Wait!

In my opinion, the first step in starting a new language or framework is to go through the official documentation. I mean, it makes sense to first check the official resource written by the person or people who created or invented the language or framework. You agree with me, don't you? So head on to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/) and try out the official tutorial if you haven't.

If you are a beginner and you need to speed up your learning pathway effectively and efficiently, you should **_study _**these books in the following **order**:

1. Django for Beginners
2. Django3 By Example
3. Django for APIs
4. Django for Professionals
5. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2
