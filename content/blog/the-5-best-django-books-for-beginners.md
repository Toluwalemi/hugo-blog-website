I know what you are thinking; _"There are a million and one 'Top Django books for beginners', why is this any different?"_

From my point of view, most of those blog posts you've read do not actually provide an efficient learning pathway. They mostly recommend popular Django books without considering a systematic order in which a beginner should follow. You should take it from someone who has tried out countless books and video tutorials; You do not want to get lost in that dark-frustrating-bottomless pit.

Hence, I have taken the time to pick out the five(5) quality books you should follow if you want to quickly master Django and solve problems with it. The order of the books mentioned here matters a lot, and you'll do yourself more good if you follow them in the order presented here.

### **First things first...**

In my opinion, the first step in starting a new language or framework is to go through the official documentation. I mean, it makes sense to first check the official resource written by the person or people who created or invented the language or framework. Right? So refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/) and try out the official tutorial if you haven't.

**PS:** _Unlike some of those posts you've come across, this is not a paid promotion. I wasn't paid to promote any of the books mentioned here._

### **Assumptions**

* You have a basic understanding of what Django is and its applications.
* You have a basic understanding of what web development entails.

### **What are the books?**

If you are a beginner and you need to speed up your learning pathway effectively and efficiently, you should **_study_** these books in the following **order**:

1. Django for Beginners
2. Django3 By Example
3. Django for APIs
4. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2
5. Django for Professionals

#### **1. Django for Beginners** _by William S. Vincent_

![Book Cover Image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sB4CmErSL._AC_UY218_.jpg "Django for Begineers")

After you must have completed the tutorial on the official documentation, there's a chance you still feel lost or overwhelmed. William Vincent comes to the rescue by brilliantly shining in standard Django practices and concepts—ranging from testing to deployment—needed to build modern web applications in a very simple manner. You get hands-on experience in building, testing and deploying web apps like a _Message Board_ app, a _Blog_ app, and a _Newspaper_ app. The writing was easy to follow, with clear explanations of new concepts. I thought the introduction of test-driven development (at this early stage) was brilliant.

#### **2. Django 3 by Example** _by Antonio Melé_

Range. Depth. Quality. Antonio Melé's very detailed book not only provides a range of web projects to build, but it also goes into the whys and wherefores of how the projects are built. If you followed the _Blog_ app tutorial in _Django for Beginners_, be ready to build a more robust _Blog_ app that covers the many features of a modern-day blog application. In fact, most of the projects you will be building—a Social Website, an E-Commerce website, an E-learning website, among others—contain full-flavoured features. Building the different projects in this book really helped me learn and apply concepts like asynchronous tasks, rendering and caching, among others. I feel that this book would have been a perfect 10 if the projects were centred around test-driven development.

#### **3. Django for APIs** _by William S. Vincent_

![Book Cover Image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tQQ39uicL._AC_UY218_.jpg "Django for APIs")

According to the author, this book is suitable for beginners who have never built an API before as well as professional programmers looking for a fast-paced introduction to Django fundamentals and best practices. This book introduces a new tool, _Django REST Framework (DRF)_, which you will use to build a _Todo API_ and a _Blog API_ as well as consuming these APIs with a frontend tool (_React)_. After I tried out the [official tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/) on DRF, I found this book extremely helpful in actually understanding how to build Web APIs with Django. Although _Django 3 by Example_ has a project on building an API with DRF, it is not suitable for a beginner who has little understanding of Web APIs.

#### **4. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2** _by Federico Marani_

![Book Cover Image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xWMIHf7oL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "Practical Django 2")

As of the writing of this blog post, I have not _yet_ practised the projects in this book but I have glanced through the contents and once I practice this I will come back and update this blog post. You are probably wondering; "Why then did you recommend it since you have not tried it?"

I personally didn’t care for the protagonist; the snarky anti-hero schtick got old after a while.

#### **5. Django for Professionals** _by William S. Vincent_

![Book Cover Image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vnww0I2TL._AC_UY218_.jpg "Django for Pros")

Ever wondered what a professional and production-ready web application would entail? William Vincent, again, comes to the rescue by breaking down some technical jargon—like containerisation, advanced security, and performance—in easy-to-understand rhetorics. Like his other books mentioned here, you get hands-on experience in building a _Bookstore_ website from scratch (professionally) using tools like Docker and PostgreSQL. His clear explanations into the world of containerisation instantly illuminated my mind like how you shine a touch on an ignorant mind.
