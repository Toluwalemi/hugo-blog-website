I know what you are thinking; _"There are a million and one 'Top Django books for beginners', why is this any different?"_

From my point of view, most of those blog posts you've read do not actually provide an efficient learning pathway. They mostly recommend popular Django books without considering a systematic order in which a beginner should follow. You should take it from someone who has tried out countless books and video tutorials; You do not want to get lost in that dark-frustrating-bottomless pit.

Hence, I have taken the time to recommend five(5) quality books you should follow if you want to quickly master Django and solve problems with it. The order of the books mentioned here matters a lot, and you'll do yourself more good if you follow them in the order presented here

### **First things first...**

In my opinion, the first step in starting a new language or framework is to go through the official documentation. I mean, it makes sense to first check the official resource written by the person or people who created or invented the language or framework. Right? So refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/) and try out the official tutorial if you haven't.

**PS:** _Unlike some of those posts you've come across, this is not a paid promotion. I wasn't paid to promote any of the books mentioned here._

### **Assumptions**

* You have a basic understanding of what Django is and its applications
* You have a basic understanding of what web development entails.

### **What are the books?**

If you are a beginner and you need to speed up your learning pathway effectively and efficiently, you should **_study_** these books in the following **order**:

1. Django for Beginners
2. Django3 By Example
3. Django for APIs
4. Practical Django 2 and Channels 2
5. Django for Professionals

#### **1. Django for Beginners** _by William S. Vincent_

After you must have completed the tutorial on the official documentation, there's a chance you still feel lost or overwhelmed. William Vincent comes to the rescue by brilliantly shining in standard practices and concepts—ranging from testing to deployment—needed to build modern web applications in a very simple manner. You get hands-on experience in building, testing and deploying web apps like a _Message Board_ app, a _Blog_ app, and a _Newspaper_ app. The writing was easy to follow, with clear explanations of new concepts. I thought the introduction of test-driven development (at this early stage) was brilliant.

#### **2. Django 3 by Example** _by Antonio Melé_

Ever wondered what the lovechild of _Twilight_ and _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ would look like?
