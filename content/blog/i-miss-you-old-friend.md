Hey, old friend!

Remember when we were inseparable?

Remember when the whole world thought we were identical twins?

Remember when I would always annoy you?

How is it that you never got angry?

Not even an iota of disdain

I blame myself for this seemingly distant friendship

Maybe things could go back to the way they were

But I highly doubt that

Perhaps the Universe's way of punishing me for my negligence

The silver lining is that we've got each other

And that's enough for me

I just want you to be happy, successful, and in good health

And I'm rooting for you, always

I miss you, old friend
