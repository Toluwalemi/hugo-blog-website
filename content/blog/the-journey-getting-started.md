It took me three blog attempts to finally reach here.

My first blog, created with WordPress, was about Premier League football. I abandoned it after writing just a single blog post. The second attempt was during my internship. I created the blog with Django and I was looking forward to sharing my experiences and thoughts with you through writing. Again, after my first blog post, I abandoned it. Fast forward to August last year, I made up my mind to use my Medium account. I was more determined than ever. I could feel the energy surging through my body and after performing some faux mental gymnastics, guess what? I abandoned it!

However much I tried there was always an indefinable something (or excuse) that stood in the way of going further.

Now, I have this blog which I created using the [Hugo framework](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend/). Two of the great merits of this beautiful framework is its simplicity and the fact that I do not have to 'code' everything from scratch.  Later on, I will write a detailed article on how you can create your blog/website using Hugo.

My name is [Toluwalemi](http://www.toluwalemi.com/about/), a Software Engineer, Content Writer, and a Candidate for BS in Computer Science, University of Ibadan. I created this blog to write and share articles ranging from Django and Web Development to topics of interest and random thoughts. If you are into software development or you enjoy reading random blog posts or you have no idea how you got here, then you're in the right place. Don't fret, I won't abandon this blog after this post. Scout's honour!

Much of my free time is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills while embarking on [different projects.](http://www.toluwalemi.com/portfolio/) When not engaged in technical work, I'm an avid reader (you can take a look at my [reading list](https://blog.toluwalemi.com/reading/)) and I also enjoy playing football and watching TV shows. (Manchester United is THE club and Messi is the G.O.A.T.)

I do hope to write more articles and share my experiences with you as I surge forward in understanding the whys and wherefores of software development and life in general. My inner voice has been wailing all these years to do this. Recently, this inner voice reached a fiendish crescendo - now I'm really excited to embark on this new route I haven't trodden before.
